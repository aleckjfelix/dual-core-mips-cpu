## General Information
This project was created as the final project for ENEE459D - Topics in Computer Engineering; Advanced Laboratory of Digital Systems Using SystemVerilog.
This is a MIPS CPU featuring two identical cores. A simplified arbiter, memory management unit (MMU), and read-only-memory (ROM) with firmware was created to
allow the cores to work together. 11 32-bit instructions of the R, I, an J type are implemented. A RAM module implementig a Fibonacci program was created to verify
CPU operation. Additionally, a randomized test bench was implemented in SystemVerilog.
